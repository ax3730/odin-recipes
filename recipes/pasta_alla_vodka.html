    <h2>Tasty pasta alla vodka recipe</h2>
    <p>This recipe was inspired from my wife, who showed me this amazing dish some
    time ago. It is simple but flavorful! </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 yellow onion peeled and minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic large, minced</li>
        <li>6 ounces of tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 pinch of kosher salt</li>
        <li>3 ounces of Vodka</li>
        <li>1 pound of pasta of choice</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1-2 to 3/4 cup of pasta water - Reserved</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes </li>
        <li>2 ounces finely grated parmesan - Plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>Minced italian parlsey chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large saucepan, set over medium-low heat, add the olive oil. When warm, 
            add the minced onion, garlic and a pinch of kosher salt. Cook until softened, 
            about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in the tomato paste, along with the red pepper flakes, and cook it until 
            the tomato paste turns a really dark red color, about 3 minutes. Add the vodka 
            and let it sizzle and allow the vodka to cook off a bit, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour in the heavy cream and mix it until smooth. Turn off the sauce. Now, 
            weâ€™re gonna boil the pasta!</li>
        <li>Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. You want the water as salty as the sea. 
            Pour in the pasta and cook it until about 1 minute shy of al dente. Reserve 
            about 1 cup of pasta water. Drain the pasta.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat up on the sauce to medium. Pour in 1/2 cup pasta water, 
            along with the grated Parmesan-Reggiano and give it a taste. Add salt to 
            taste. I added a pinch or two. Pour in the pasta and then add in the cold 
            butter. Mix it vigorously for 1 minute, until thick and luscious.</li>
            <li>Garnish with grated Parmesan-Reggiano and some minced Italian parsley.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Enjoy!!</h3>
