    <h2>Tasty Lemon Pepper Recipe</h2>
    <p>This recipe is a staple in my house. Very little prep time and easy to make. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pound side of salmon - Skin on or off upon your preference</li>
        <li>10 sprigs of fresh thyme - optional but delicious</li>
        <li>2 medium lemons</li>
        <li>1 1/4 pounds shrimp, shelled with tails on or off</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dry white wine or broth</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black papper - plus additional to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh parlsey chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the salmon from the refrigerator, and let stand at room temperature
            for 10 minutes while you prepare the other ingredients. Heat oven to 375 
            degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet large enough to hold your piece of 
            salmon with a large piece of aluminum foil. If you prefer the salmon not 
            to touch the foil, lay a sheet of parchment paper on top. </li>
        <li>Lightly coat the foil with baking spay, then arrange 5 sprigs of the thyme 
            down the middle. Cut one of the lemons into thin slices and arrange half 
            of the slices down the middle too. Place the salmon on top.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the salmon with the olive oil. Zest the second lemon over the salmon 
            and sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Lay the remaining thyme and lemon 
            slices on top of the salmon. Juice the zested lemon, then pour the juice 
            over the top.</li>
        <li>Fold the sides of the aluminum foil up and over the top of the salmon until 
            it is completely enclosed. If your piece of foil is not large enough, place 
            a second piece on top and fold the edges under so that it forms a sealed
            packet. Leave a little room inside the foil for air to circulate..</li>
        <li>Bake the salmon for 18-21 minutes, until the salmon is almost completely 
            cooked through at the thickest part. The cooking time will vary based on 
            the thickness of your salmon. If your side is thinner (around 1-inch thick)
            check several minutes early to ensure your salmon does not overcook. If 
            your piece is very thick (1 1/2 inches or more), it may need longer.</li>
        <li>Remove the salmon from the oven, and carefully open the foil so that the top 
            of the fish is completely uncovered (be careful of hot steam). Change the oven 
            setting to broil, then return the fish to the oven and broil for 3 minutes,
             until the top of the salmon is slightly golden and the fish is cooked through
            completely. Watch the salmon closely as it broils to make sure it doesn’t
            overcook. Remove the salmon from the oven. If it still appears a bit 
            underdone, you can wrap the foil back over the top and let it rest for a 
            few minutes. Do not let it sit too long—salmon can progress from "not done" to
            "over done" very quickly. As soon as it flakes easily with a fork, it's ready.</li>
        <li>To serve, cut the salmon into portions. Sprinkle with additional fresh herbs or top
            with an extra squeeze of lemon as desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Enjoy!!</h3>
