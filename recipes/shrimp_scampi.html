    <h2>Delicious shrimp scampi recipe</h2>
    <p>This recipe was inspired from my wife, who showed me this amazing dish some
    time ago. It is simple but flavorful! </p>

        <li>1 1/4 pounds shrimp, shelled with tails on or off</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch cracked pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dry white wine or broth</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes - optional</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh parlsey chopped</li>
    </ul>

            minutes on one side (until just beginning to turn pink), then flip. </li>

            for 1-2 minutes or until wine reduces by about half and the shrimp is cooked
             through (don't over cook your shrimp).</li>
